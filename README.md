# Day 1 
## Goals 
To see how well you understand loops, conditions and arrays in Javascript.

## Summary
Build a sequential background color changing gradient website.

## Intructions
- Create a Github repository containing a suitable name for your task.
- Clone the empty repository to your local machine
- In the folder created on cloning the repository, create a one page website that changes its background - - - - gradient sequentially on clicking on the previous and next button. This means on clicking the next button, -  the background gradient should change to the next gradient in the default colors list; the reverse should happen on clicking the previous button.
- The initial background gradient on viewing the page for the first time must be (#780206 and #061161).
- A default list of background colors must be used. (Its referenced below)
- Once the default colors are exhausted, the background should again change to the first gradient on the list.
- Once the page is completed, push your changes to Github.
- Deploy it on Github pages.
